Back Tracking is usualy -> Recussion + controlled Recussion + pass by reference

Identifications -> usualy asked to find all the Combinations

Concept - Pass by value and pass by reference

Key Points:
Everything in Python is passed by object reference.
This means the reference to the object is passed to the function, not the actual value.
Whether the function can modify the original object depends on whether the object is mutable or immutable.


Identifications

1. choices + Decisions
2. All Combinations
3. Controlled Recussion
4. Number of choices
5. Size of Constraints
6. Dont be greedy



pseudo Code


void solve(&v) -> pass by reference
    if isSolve() == True: -> Base Condition
        print or return  -> whatever is the condition
    
    for choice in choices:
        if isValid == True:
            change the varibale v 
            then again call the function solve

            now return changes in v
